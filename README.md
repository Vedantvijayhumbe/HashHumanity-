*A Web3 based Refugee Re-allocation and Re-habilation platform for Document verification ,Microloan via DE-FI , and donation *  

### **🚀 Overview**  
○ Decentralized identity and Financial inclusion platform for refugees•

•Problem Statement :
Over  100 million refugees lack legal identification, trapping them in a cycle of exclusion:  
 - No access to banking, microloans, or a stable jobs.  
 - No privacy :– centralized systems expose sensitive data to exploitation.  
 - No trust :– governments/NGOs struggle to verify credentials across borders.

Our solution includes:-
 - Soulbound Tokens (SBTs): Issued by trusted NGOs/UN agencies (e.g., UNHCR) as non-transferable IDs, storing verified credentials (biometrics, education, medical records).  
 - Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): Refugees prove eligibility (e.g., "no criminal record") without exposing sensitive data.  
 -Microloans via DeFi: On-chain credit scores based on transaction history (e.g., repaid loans) unlock small loans in stablecoins (USDC).
